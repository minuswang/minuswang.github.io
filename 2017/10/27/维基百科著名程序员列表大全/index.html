<p>##野心勃勃的284人采访计划</p>
<p>这是一份雄心勃勃的名单，Peter Seibel准备一一采访284位著名程序员的人员名单，可以说是涵括了IT历史上最有影响力的程序员，当然是在世的，要不他如何去采访啊。今年6月份，他第一阶段采访的成果就要出版了，前16个访谈成为第一本书，书名《Coders at Work 》。要是真的全部完成284人的采访，非得需要十多本书籍才行，那就真是著作等身不可。我们今天转贴他的这份名单，把她介绍给网友，参与或关注他的工程，作为我们互联网百科的建设指南。<br>Programmers at Work的评论编辑本段回目录</p>
<p> 来自: g9<br>　　PC时代初期犹如拓荒小说里的南非。拓荒者们没有精巧的工具，没有丰厚的财力，没有经验，甚至没有足够的食物。一人一镐一簸箕，和百折不挠的狂热而已。然而风云际会，不定一镐下去，就是非洲之星。二、三十年前的黑客们就是PC时代的拓荒者。技术原始，无损他们奔放的想象力。工具粗陋，却激起他们征服的雄心。那时没有铺天盖地的类库，所以他们钻研P.J. Plauger的雄文。那时没有巨无霸一样的操作系统，所以他们细读Lion的经典。那时没有趁手的软件，所以他们创造奇迹。作为程序员，想来多少对这段动人往事好奇。Dan Bricklin怎么就做出了spreadsheet？Ray Ozzie从哪里得到关于群件的灵感？Jef Raskin如何让Machintosh成为PC的不朽经典？Butler Lampson发明所见即所得编辑器和Ethernet时，经历了怎样的顿悟？正如Peter Norvig在书评里所说，理解编程，除了学习黑客们铿锵的代码外，也许还要了解他们丰富的内心。虽说高手不可模仿，因为“学问跟他整个的性情陶融为一片，不仅有丰富的数量，还添上个别的性质；每一个琐细的事实，都在他的心血里沉浸滋养，长了神经和脉络，是你所学不会，学不到的”，但我们无疑可以受到不小的启发。如果能被他们打动，分享同样的激情，也算一庄美事。好在20年前Susan Lammers采访了书写历史的19名程序员。她把这些访谈集结出版，于是有了让众多程序员心潮澎湃的经典：Programmers at Work。记得是等公共汽车，为了排遣无聊翻看这本书。结果一看入神，错过了最后一班车。干脆走两小时路回家。一边走一边把书看完。当时我还几乎不懂编程。好比连烟都没抽过的人突然静脉注射高纯度海洛因，被刺激得死去活来。:-P 有兴趣的老大可以到这里读第一版的存档。<br>　　<br>　　当然，19人，400页怎么能写尽前辈风范呢？何况IT业是古龙书中高手辈出的天下，而不是金庸笔下老人无敌的江湖。20年时移势易，早有新人名动五洲。不知别人如何，反正俺盼着有人再出类似的书。还好，Apress在Founders at Work（也是好书，顺便推荐一下）上尝到了甜头，于是趁热打铁，请Practical Common Lisp(Lisp的书居然能得Jolt奖，还是值得翻一下的哈)的作者Peter Seibel写Coders At Work。Peter能把Common Lisp的宏编程写得通俗易懂，能让铁杆儿C++/Java程序员对Common Lisp动心，笔头自是没话说。他的采访对象也是俺这种小喽喽仰望的对象。这里汇总了他采访的候选对象，凡284人。有意思的是大家心目中的超级高手大体一致。按投票数排序，前25位都是大家耳熟能详并且深刻改变我们生活的牛程。后面的就见仁见智了。比如说Google的Jeff Dean居然排在121位。而近几年光说不练Paul Graham排在第23位。下面是已经答应接受采访的程序员名单，让人神往：<br>　　Joe Armstrong — Erlang作者<br>　　Bernie Cosell — ARPANET的IMP主要作者之一<br>　　Simon Peyton Jones — Haskell的发明人之一<br>　　Alan Kay — Smalltalk的发明人<br>　　Donald Knuth — 《编程的艺术》和Tex的作者.<br>　　Peter Norvig — AI: A Modern Approach和Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming的作者<br>　　Ken Thompson — Unix的发明人<br>　　Jamie Zawinski — XEmacs和Netscape的主程</p>
